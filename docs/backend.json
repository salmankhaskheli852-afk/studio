    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability for the InvestPro Wallet application. It leverages path-based ownership for user-specific data and structural segregation to maintain a homogeneous security posture within each collection. Denormalization is employed to avoid `get()` calls in security rules and ensure atomic operations.\n\n*   **Users:** Each user has their own document in the `/users` collection. This allows for simple, path-based security rules that restrict access to a user's data only to themselves.\n*   **Wallets:** Each user has a single associated wallet stored in `/users/{userId}/wallet`. Path-based ownership ensures only the user can access their wallet.\n*   **Transactions:** Each wallet has multiple transactions, stored in `/users/{userId}/wallet/transactions/{transactionId}`. Again, path-based ownership ensures only the user can access their transactions.\n*   **Investment Plans:** Investment plans are stored in a root-level `/investment_plans` collection. These plans are globally accessible but writes are restricted to authorized roles (e.g., admins, not modeled here).\n*   **Admin Wallet Details:** These are stored in the root-level `/admin_wallet_details` collection. Read access can be controlled, and write access can be limited to admins (roles are not modeled, but an example is provided).\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved primarily through path-based ownership. For example, to access a user's transactions, we don't need to `get()` the wallet to verify ownership; the path `/users/{userId}/wallet/transactions/{transactionId}` inherently enforces this. This eliminates hierarchical authorization dependencies.\n\nQAPs (Rules are not Filters) are supported by the structural segregation. For example, listing transactions is always scoped to a specific user's wallet due to the path structure. This ensures that list operations are secure and efficient without complex filtering in the rules."
